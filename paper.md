#Introduction
We present smoke and fire collected in our studies.

Smoke was collected using a large glass jar (Bloggs et al.)

Lee et al (2001) conducted several studies in this region but continent scale measurements have not previously been made.

We enjoy field work and being in the outdoors

# Simulations
we simulate the amount of smoke made during different sized fires

# Methods
We compared our smoke measurements with model simulation .
The model is detailed in Smith et al. 2002

# Results
The simulations indicate that the more fuel is on the fire the more smoke is made

# Figures

#Conclusions
We have discovered the origins of fire and the relation to smoke production.
